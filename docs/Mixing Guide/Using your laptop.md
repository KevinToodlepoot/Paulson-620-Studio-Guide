# Using Your Laptop

Sometimes you have your project all set up on your laptop and don't want to bother with bringing it over to the Studio computer. It's a very simple process to get your laptop connected to the Speakers.

# Download Drivers

The first thing you want to do is download the drivers necessary to connecting to our interface. The drivers can be found [here](https://rme-audio.de/digiface-dante.html). Navigate to the "Drivers" tab, select your operating system, and download and install the necessary drivers. 

If you're running MacOS 11 and up, here are the direct links to the drivers that you will want to install:

[macOS 11 or up USB Series DriverKit Driver](https://rme-audio.de/downloads/driver_usbdk_mac_410.zip)

[macOS 11 and up USB Series Kernel Extension Driver](https://rme-audio.de/downloads/driver_usb_mac_331.zip)

Follow the installation instructions and restart your machine.

# Connecting to the RME
There should be a USB cable that comes through the board next to the headphone port. Plug this into your machine.

On your laptop you should see a software called "Totalmix" open. This means you installed all the drivers correctly and are ready to get started! Simply open the DADman application on the Studio computer, and select "Guest Laptop" as the output source.

Tip: The outputs are configured from 1-12 in this order:
